# Machine Learning CS542 Final Project 
## Convolutional Neural Network for the classification of Fashion MNIST
Authors: Nanna Katrin Hannesdottir, Fatemeh Sharifi and Shahaf Dan

### Download and running instructions
#### Datasets
The Fashion MNIST dataset we used was retrieved at: https://www.kaggle.com/zalando-research/fashionmnist <br>
For your convenience we have also uploaded it to this repository under archive.zip <br>

The other dataset we looked at, Fashion Product Images, can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/paramaggarwal/fashion-product-images-small

#### Packages and imports
For our implementation we used PyTorch, and various pytorch libraries so make sure to have that installed.

Additional python libraries needed to have installed are:
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- cv2
- PIL (pillow)
- sklearn

#### Running the algorithm
All necessary code to import, train and test to get our results for  the Fashion MNSIT data is found in 'Image_Classifier_Project_MAIN.ipynb'<br>

For the code on our experiment with the more complex dataset you should first download the data from the kaggle link, then run 'Fashion_Images_PreProcess.ipynb'
to recode and generate two numpy arrays with the data ready for testing, and then finally run 'Image_Classifier_WithNewData.ipynb' which trains the model and tests on the new data.

**Note:** The training might take some time, even on a gpu, but usually <2 hours
